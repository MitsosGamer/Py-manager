# Py-Manager

This repository contains the py-manager.

What is the py-manager?
 The py-manager is one of my first programs, that allows you to generate passwords and save them in a json file.
 It works like a password manager, that's why it is called py-manageer.
 
Usage:
 Click on menu.py
 
Requirements:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
